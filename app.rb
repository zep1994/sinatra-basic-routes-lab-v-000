The Beatles were good, but try Since I've Been Loving You Live Madison Square Garden 1973.. haha John Lennons ass up there with Paul McCartney rocking on the mic! Subjectivly I have no clue becaue I put all my energy into proving Led Zeppelin is the greatist.. do not even bring up anyone of today.. Taylor Swift has not contributed to a music wave that part of a counter culture movement made high school drop outs rates pretty much increase 10%. Sure unfortnuate and numbers are great but the vibe is not. GEEEEEZ I could go on."
